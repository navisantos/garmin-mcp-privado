## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Garmin Personal API support.** Set `GARMIN_PERSONAL_API_KEY` (create it at
  https://connect.garmin.com/app/settings/personalApiToken) and the server reads
  from Garmin's official API instead of logging in with email/password/MFA. The
  key is exchanged for a 24h bearer token that is renewed automatically and kept
  in memory only. Activities, laps (parsed from the original `.fit`), daily
  stats, sleep, heart rate, Body Battery, HRV and VO2 max are served this way.
  Tools the Personal API doesn't offer (`get_training_status`,
  `get_personal_records`, `get_threshold_history`, lactate threshold and race
  predictions in `get_performance_metrics`) fall back to the legacy login when
  one is configured, otherwise return a clear error. Without the key nothing
  changes.
- `get_hrv(date)` — overnight HRV summary.
- `GARMIN_TZ` env var to choose the timezone used for "today" (default
  `Europe/Oslo`).

### Changed
- Dockerfile: the connector's secret URL path now comes from the `MCP_PATH`
  environment variable instead of being hardcoded; the container refuses to
  start without it.
- `get_personal_records()` — personal records / PBs. Labels the common running
  records (fastest 1km/1mile/5km/10km, longest run) and formats their values
  (clock string for time records, "X.XX km" for distance); any other/unmapped
  record keeps its raw `type_id` and `value` with a null label so it is never
  mislabeled.
- `get_threshold_history(start_date, end_date, aggregation="weekly")` —
  lactate-threshold heart rate + pace as a dated trend series (uses the ranged
  `get_lactate_threshold`), for tracking whether threshold is improving across a
  training block. Shape-tolerant: an unparseable range payload is returned
  verbatim under `raw` rather than dropped.
- `get_performance_metrics(date=None)` — running fitness/threshold snapshot in
  one call: lactate threshold (threshold heart rate + threshold pace, converted
  from Garmin's scaled speed field to "M:SS/km"), VO2 max + fitness age, and 5k/10k/half/
  marathon race predictions (converted from seconds to clock strings). Each of
  the three sections is fetched independently, so one unavailable endpoint
  becomes `{"error": ...}` while the others still return, and every section
  carries its own `measured_date` so stale values are visible. Covers the
  "prestasjons-/terskelhistorikk" item from the roadmap's Phase 3.
- `get_activity_laps(activity_id, include_gps=False)` — per-lap breakdown
  (distance, elapsed/timer/moving durations, pace, avg/max HR, avg/max power,
  cadence, interval intensity, elevation). Enables interval and split
  analysis instead of only the aggregate summary. GPS coordinates are
  stripped by default and opt-in via `include_gps`.
- `get_activity_details` now includes an explicit `timing` object
  (`elapsed_time_s` / `timer_time_s` / `moving_time_s` / `stopped_time_s`) so
  callers no longer have to guess which duration is the finish time.

### Fixed
- `get_performance_metrics()` resolved its default date from the *host's*
  timezone, so on a UTC server every session logged after 22:00 Norwegian time
  (23:00 in winter) was attributed to the previous day. "Today" is now resolved
  in `Europe/Oslo`, with a fallback to the host's local date if the system has
  no tz database.
- CI was red on every branch, including untouched `main`: `ruff` was declared
  without a version, and 0.16.1 widened the default rule set to flag five
  pre-existing violations. `ruff` is now pinned to `==0.16.1` and the five
  violations are fixed (`UP035` `Callable` import, two redundant `int(round(…))`
  casts, `DTZ011` above, `PLW1510` explicit `check=False` in a test). Same root
  cause as the `mcp[cli]` incident: an unpinned tool breaking on its own release
  schedule.
- Server failed to start with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'mcp.server.fastmcp'` after the MCP SDK released 2.0.0, which removed that
  module. The `mcp[cli]` dependency was declared without a version ceiling, so
  any fresh dependency resolution silently pulled the incompatible major
  version — taking down long-running installs on their next restart. Now pinned
  to `>=1.0,<2`. Lift the ceiling only together with a port to the 2.x API.
- Threshold pace was reported ~10× too slow (e.g. `40:00/km` instead of
  `4:00/km`) in `get_performance_metrics` and `get_threshold_history`. Garmin's
  lactate-threshold endpoints report speed in units of 10 m/s (true m/s ÷ 10),
  unlike activity `averageSpeed` which is plain m/s; the raw value is now scaled
  by `LT_SPEED_SCALE` before pace conversion. Threshold HR and power are
  unaffected. Verified against a same-day track session whose activity
  `averageSpeed` matched the raw threshold speed × 10.
- `get_threshold_history` returned an empty `points` list (falling back to
  `raw`) because the ranged payload keys each point's date under `from`, which
  `_extract_stat_series` did not recognize. `from` is now an accepted date key,
  so the trend series populates correctly.
