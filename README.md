# Garmin MCP Server

Connect Claude (or any MCP client) to your Garmin Connect data — activities, sleep, heart rate, body battery, and training status.

## What you can ask

- "How did I sleep this week?"
- "What was my average pace on my last 5 runs?"
- "Is my resting heart rate trending down?"
- "Should I train hard today based on my body battery?"
- "Summarize my training status and VO2 max trend."
- "What's my lactate threshold heart rate and pace right now?"
- "What 10k time does Garmin predict for me?"
- "What are my running personal records?"
- "Has my threshold pace improved over the last three months?"

## Quick Start

### 1. One-time login

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/Sinfjell/garmin-mcp garmin-mcp-auth
```

Prompts for your Garmin Connect email and password (or reads `GARMIN_EMAIL` /
`GARMIN_PASSWORD` from the environment), handles MFA if your account uses it,
and caches a session token locally so you won't be prompted again.

### 2. Add it to your MCP client

**Claude Desktop** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/Sinfjell/garmin-mcp", "garmin-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code**:

```bash
claude mcp add garmin -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/Sinfjell/garmin-mcp garmin-mcp
```

**Cursor** — add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/Sinfjell/garmin-mcp", "garmin-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Ask a question

Restart your client and ask something like "How did I sleep last night?"

## Tools

| Tool | Returns |
|---|---|
| `list_recent_activities(limit=10)` | Recent activities: date, type, name, distance, duration, avg HR, pace |
| `get_activity_details(activity_id)` | Full detail for one activity, incl. explicit elapsed/timer/moving/stopped timing (stripped of bulky sample/GPS data) |
| `get_activity_laps(activity_id, include_gps=False)` | Per-lap breakdown: distance, durations, pace, HR, power, cadence, interval intensity (WARMUP/ACTIVE/REST) |
| `list_activities_by_date(start_date, end_date)` | Activity summaries in a date range |
| `get_daily_stats(date)` | Steps, calories, resting HR, stress for one day |
| `get_sleep(date)` | Sleep stages, sleep score, overnight HRV and resting HR |
| `get_heart_rate(date)` | Min/max/resting HR and 7-day average resting HR for one day |
| `get_body_battery(start_date, end_date)` | Body Battery charged/drained/highest/lowest per day |
| `get_training_status(date)` | Training status, load, VO2 max, heat/altitude acclimation |
| `get_performance_metrics(date=None)` | Running fitness/threshold snapshot: lactate threshold (LTHR + pace), VO2 max + fitness age, and 5k/10k/half/marathon race predictions |
| `get_personal_records()` | Personal records / PBs: fastest 1km/1mile/5km/10km, longest run (labeled), plus raw type/value for any other record |
| `get_threshold_history(start_date, end_date, aggregation="weekly")` | Lactate-threshold HR + pace as a dated trend series over a range |

All dates are `"YYYY-MM-DD"`. All tools return compact JSON.

## Authentication

`garmin-mcp-auth` is the recommended way to log in — it supports MFA and
caches a token so the server doesn't need your password on every run.

**Environment variable alternative:** set `GARMIN_EMAIL` and `GARMIN_PASSWORD`
(see `.env.example`) and the server will log in non-interactively if no
cached token is found. This does not support MFA — accounts with MFA enabled
should use `garmin-mcp-auth` instead.

**Token cache location:** `~/.garminconnect` by default, or the path in
`GARMIN_TOKENS` if set.

## Personal API key (recommended)

Garmin now offers an official way to read your own data. Create a key at
<https://connect.garmin.com/app/settings/personalApiToken> and set it as
`GARMIN_PERSONAL_API_KEY`. No email, password or MFA is involved, and the
server renews the 24-hour access token by itself. The key expires after the
period you pick (30 days to 1 year); Garmin emails a reminder a week before, and
you replace it by deleting the old key and creating a new one.

The Personal API is read-only and covers activities (including `.fit` files, used
for laps), daily stats, sleep, heart rate, Body Battery, HRV and VO2 max. It does
**not** offer training status, personal records, lactate threshold or race
predictions — those tools use the legacy login below if you keep one configured,
and otherwise return an error.

## Remote / hosted mode (use from Claude mobile & web)

By default this server speaks stdio and is meant to run as a local subprocess
of your MCP client. You can instead run it as a long-lived HTTP service and
add it to claude.ai as a **custom connector**, which also makes it reachable
from Claude on mobile.

### 1. Log in once, on the host

```bash
garmin-mcp-auth
```

Run this on the machine that will host the server (interactively, so it can
handle MFA). The cached token in `~/.garminconnect` (or `GARMIN_TOKENS`) is
reused on every request — the server does not log in again per request.
Avoid triggering fresh logins often: Garmin rate-limits and sometimes blocks
sign-ins from datacenter IPs, so a stable, long-lived cached session is the
goal, not routine re-auth.

### 2. Run the server in streamable-http mode

```bash
garmin-mcp --transport streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --path /<random-secret>/mcp
```

- `--transport streamable-http` switches from stdio to an HTTP endpoint.
- `--host` / `--port` control what the server binds to (default
  `127.0.0.1:8765` — bind to `127.0.0.1` and put a reverse proxy in front
  rather than exposing the process directly).
- `--path` sets the URL path the MCP endpoint mounts at (default `/mcp`).
  Set it to a long random value (e.g. `/8f2c1a9e7b.../mcp`) and treat it as a
  secret — see below.

### 3. Put TLS and a reverse proxy in front

This mode has no built-in authentication. The security model is:

- **The path is the secret.** Anyone with the full URL — including the
  random path segment — can call every tool and read your Garmin data.
  Anyone without it gets a 404. This is possession-of-URL security, not real
  authentication — good enough for a personal deployment you control, not
  for anything shared or high-stakes.
- **TLS is required in practice.** Run the server behind a reverse proxy
  (Caddy, nginx, Cloudflare Tunnel, etc.) that terminates HTTPS, so the
  secret path isn't sent in the clear. Point the proxy at
  `127.0.0.1:<port>` and expose only the proxy's HTTPS URL.
- Don't log the URL, commit it, or paste it anywhere public — it's
  effectively a credential.

### 4. Add it to claude.ai as a custom connector

In claude.ai: **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**, then paste
your full HTTPS URL (e.g. `https://mcp.example.com/8f2c1a9e7b.../mcp`). Once
added, it's available from Claude on web and mobile, not just Claude Code or
Desktop.

## Security & privacy

- Your credentials never leave your machine and are never stored by this
  server — only a session token is cached locally.
- This server is **read-only**: it never writes to, modifies, or deletes
  anything in Garmin Connect.
- Nothing is sent anywhere except Garmin's own API — no third-party
  telemetry, analytics, or logging.

## Troubleshooting

**"Garmin authentication expired" / auth errors** — run `garmin-mcp-auth`
again to refresh your session.

**Stuck in an MFA loop** — make sure you're running `garmin-mcp-auth`
interactively (not through a client that swallows stdin); the MFA code
prompt needs a real terminal.

**Wrong Python version** — this package requires Python 3.10+. Check with
`python3 --version`; `uvx` will otherwise fail to build the environment.
